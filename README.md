# Hotel Reservation System

## Overview

Welcome to the Hotel Reservation System project! This project serves as a practical exercise for building a backend service in Go, designed specifically to manage hotel reservations. The system facilitates interactions with a MongoDB database through a RESTful API, allowing users to perform operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting reservations.

## Project Objectives

1. **Go Language Proficiency:** Develop proficiency in Go programming language by implementing a hotel reservation system backend.
   
2. **MongoDB Integration:** Gain experience in interacting with MongoDB, a NoSQL database, for storing and managing hotel reservation data.

3. **RESTful API Implementation:** Design and implement a RESTful API to expose endpoints for managing hotel reservations.

4. **Project Structure:** Establish a well-organized project structure adhering to best practices, facilitating modularity, scalability, and maintainability.

## Key Features

- **Reservation Management:** Create, retrieve, update, and delete hotel reservations through API endpoints.
  
- **Data Validation:** Implement validation mechanisms to ensure data integrity and security.
  
- **Error Handling:** Provide robust error handling to deliver informative responses to API consumers.
  
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Optionally, include authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure API endpoints.
  
- **Documentation:** Generate comprehensive API documentation to facilitate usage and maintenance.

## Project Structure

The project structure follows a typical Go application layout, consisting of modular components such as:

- **cmd/**: Entry point(s) for the application.
  
- **pkg/**: Reusable packages and modules.
  
- **internal/**: Application-specific internal packages.
  
- **api/**: API endpoint handlers and middleware.
  
- **db/**: MongoDB database interactions and models.
  
- **config/**: Configuration management utilities.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Go (Golang)
  
- **Database:** MongoDB
  
- **Web Framework:** Optionally, a lightweight web framework like Echo or Gin can be used for building the API.
  
- **Dependency Management:** Go Modules
  
- **Documentation:** Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Go programming language syntax and concepts.
  
- Familiarity with MongoDB and NoSQL database concepts.
  
- Knowledge of RESTful API principles.

## Outcome

Upon completion of this project, participants will have gained practical experience in developing a hotel reservation system backend in Go, integrating with MongoDB, and exposing functionality through a RESTful API. They will also have a well-structured project that can serve as a foundation for building more complex applications.

## Note

This project is intended for educational purposes and as a practical exercise to reinforce learning. It can be extended and customized based on individual requirements and preferences.
